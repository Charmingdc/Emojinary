## Overview

Emojinary is a high-performance, full-stack puzzle application that challenges users to decode phrases and concepts from AI-generated emoji sequences. Built with a focus on polished UI/UX, the project utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure infinite replayability through dynamic content generation rather than static databases.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Puzzle Generation**: Utilizes LangChain and the Groq LPU Inference Engine to generate unique, contextually relevant puzzles on the fly.
- **Dual Game Modes**: Features a "Daily Challenge" for community-wide competition and a "Classic Mode" for continuous, progressive play.
- **Intelligent Scoring System**: Calculates rewards based on difficulty tier, remaining time, and hint usage.
- **Neumorphic Interface**: A modern, tactile UI design built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for fluid transitions.
- **Cross-Platform Feedback**: Integrated haptic feedback and localized audio cues for an immersive gaming experience.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/Emojinary.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Emojinary
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

To enable AI puzzle generation, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## API Documentation

### Base URL

`/api`

### Endpoints

#### GET /generatePuzzles

**Request**:
Query Parameters:

- `count` (optional): Number of puzzles to generate (default: 8)
- `difficulty` (optional): Difficulty filter (easy | medium | hard)

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "emojis": ["⛴️", "🌊", "🏙️"],
      "letters": ["b", "h", "r", "e", "a", "t", "o", "n", "s", "r"],
      "answer": "harbor",
      "hint": "A safe haven for vessels.",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Errors**:

- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 500: Failed to generate puzzles (AI service or Parsing error)

## Usage

- **Decoding**: Analyze the emoji set in the center of the screen to identify the hidden word.
- **Input**: Select letters from the letter pool to fill the answer slots. Tapping a filled slot will return the letter to the pool.
- **Hints**: Use the lightbulb icon if you are stuck, but be aware it reduces your total point potential for that puzzle.
- **Timer**: Each difficulty level has a specific time limit. If the timer hits zero, the puzzle is marked as "skipped."
