# Emojinary API

## Overview

![Emojinary Playing Interface](/public/emojinary-screenshot-1.jpg)
![Emojinary Game End Interface](/public/emojinary-screenshot-2.jpg)

A puzzle generation engine and interactive frontend built with TypeScript and Node.js. The system utilizes Large Language Models via the Groq API and LangChain to programmatically synthesize unique emoji-based word puzzles with varying difficulty levels.

## Features

- LangChain & Groq: Leverages the gpt-oss-120b model for high-creativity puzzle synthesis and automated hint generation.
- Zod Validation: Implements strict schema enforcement for AI-generated JSON payloads to ensure runtime stability.
- Serverless Architecture: Deployed via Vercel Functions for scalable, on-demand API execution.
- React Query Integration: Optimized frontend state management for asynchronous data fetching and cache invalidation.

## Getting Started

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash

| Technology   | Purpose                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript   | Type-safe development across frontend and backend     |
| React 19     | Component-based UI architecture                       |
| LangChain    | Orchestrating LLM interactions and prompt engineering |
| Groq         | High-speed AI inference for puzzle generation         |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling and neumorphic design patterns  |
| Vite         | Frontend tooling and fast HMR                         |
| Motion       | Fluid UI animations and transitions                   |

## Usage

The application provides two distinct gameplay experiences:

- **Classic Mode**: Fetches a randomized set of puzzles from the API. Users solve them sequentially with a per-puzzle timer and scoring system based on speed and hint usage.
- **Daily Mode**: Fetches a specific, high-difficulty puzzle indexed by the current date, ensuring a shared experience for all players.

To run the project in a production-like environment, use `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`.
